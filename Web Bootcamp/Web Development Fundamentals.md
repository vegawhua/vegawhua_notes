  Server & client - open 24/7  
  - How to access www.google.com?
  1. The computer sends the request to the Internet Service Provider(ISP, e.g. AT&T)
  2. ISP will relay中继 the message to DNS(domain name server), and DNS will look up in its db as to what is the exact IP address of the website.
  3. DNS --IP address--> ISP -> PC
  4. PC --direct request to IP address--> ISP --> Internet backbone --> Server
  5. Google Server -> Internet backbone -> ISP -> PC with Google homepage
